# Problem Statement

Healthcare systems often face sudden Emergency Department surges, ICU bed shortages, and staff overload without adequate early warning. This leads to reactive decision-making, ER crowding, delayed care, and staff burnout. There is a need for an interpretable, proactive decision-support system that can forecast operational stress and recommend preventive actions before overload occurs.
